<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Anxiety</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>Anxiety is something that many people struggle with. It's difficult 
to escape entirely, as most people typically feel anxiety when put into 
stressful situations. A little anxiety has been shown to provide a 
useful boost in motivating people to perform well or to change their 
behavior if necessary. But at its most extreme, anxiety can get in the 
way of daily living and make an individual fearful of engaging in 
various situations. Anxiety can be generalized (involving a more 
distributed sense of foreboding or malaise) or specific to certain 
conditions, such as social engagement or test-taking. For individuals 
who find that anxiety creates problems in living, various therapies and 
interventions are available to encourage more positive thinking and make
 it easier to understand, process, and manage anxious feelings.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 37 on Anxiety places you higher than 10% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p>Your score on the Anxiety scale indicates that you rarely feel 
anxious. It is likely that others view you as unflappable, even in 
situations that might render most people nervous or worried. Even when 
put on the spot, you probably handle yourself quite well. You may 
therefore be much more comfortable than the average person when it comes
 to shouldering responsibility and pressure or navigating tricky 
situations.</p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>My philosophy is that worrying means you suffer twice.</ital>"<br>— Newt Scamander, 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Humor</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>People often rank Humor highly among the traits that they value in a 
potential romantic partner or friend. Individuals high in humor may be 
popular as a result of the mirth they spread around freely. They are 
likely less restrained in showing that they think something is funny, 
and more likely to keep a situation light and enjoyable through either 
their own jokes or their enthusiastic approval of others' jokes. 
However, individuals scoring low in humor are not necessarily dour... in
 fact, they may even have a very good internal sense of humor that they 
simply express less openly or express only to those close to them. Or, 
they might be more likely to express their humor through writing or art 
than through verbal laughter or loud jokes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 39 on Humor places you higher than 14% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

<div class="image-container">

<p></p>
<p>Your score on the Humor scale indicates that you are significantly 
less likely to joke around or to laugh openly and frequently. You might 
have a more serious outlook on life, which could be due to an awareness 
of life's harsh realities or the need to bear a lot of responsibility.  
This doesn't necessarily mean that you can't enjoy a good joke every now
 and then. It's simply that you're less likely to guffaw loudly at a bad
 pun or to get up on a table and dance just to entertain people.</p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>When comedy fails, seriousness begins to leak back in.</ital>"<br>— Susan Sontag</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Trust</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>Trust measures an individual's comfort at taking others at their 
word, and their willingness to believe things as they are presented. It 
also relates to ones' beliefs about the motivations of others and the 
extent to which others will treat them with fairness and objectivity. 
Individuals high in Trust are generally more likely to have an 
optimistic view of human nature and less likely to doubt the intentions 
of others. By contrast, those who are low in Trust tend to be hesitant 
about exposing their vulnerabilities to others.  They're also often 
reluctant to take others at their word — they reach their own 
conclusions only after careful consideration of the facts.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 61 on Trust places you higher than 86% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

<div class="image-container">

<p></p>
<p>Your score on the Trust scale indicates that you are very high in 
Trust. You probably believe in the fundamental honesty and goodness of 
human beings and are likely to take people at their word. You may 
therefore be more likely to accept people into your life. Though some 
might mistake your faith in humanity for gullibility, others are 
inspired by your trusting nature and wish to embody it. </p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much.</ital>"<br>— Helen Keller</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Perfectionism</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>The Perfectionism factor is one of the most intuitive to understand —
 it can be explained simply as an individual's desire for perfection. An
 individual high in Perfectionism will likely set high expectations and 
then expect those to be met, by themselves and others.  Perfectionists 
notice many errors and flaws, and are therefore often hard to satisfy. 
Their work may be of an especially high standard, but those around them 
feel pressured as they strive to meet expectations. At its most extreme,
 Perfectionism has the potential to cause difficulties in relationships.
 Individuals low in Perfectionism feel less need to aspire to lofty 
standards, and are more content with getting to the point of "good 
enough" and leaving it at that. They may have more ease in letting go of
 one project and moving on to the next than those high in Perfectionism.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 39 on Perfectionism places you higher than 14% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

<div class="image-container">

<p></p>
<p>Your score on the Perfectionism scale indicates that you are low in 
Perfectionism. You are much more comfortable with imperfection (you may 
not even perceive it as imperfection!), and flexible when things fall 
through. You may have a more pragmatic understanding of the world and 
realize that some things are out of your hands, no matter how much a 
person strains for things to turn out a certain way. Most likely, you 
have a good idea of when to let something go, when to forgive others, 
and when to move on. Others are probably much less inhibited in sharing 
their weaknesses with you. You are likely fairly easy to please, though 
others around you who are higher in Perfectionism may at times be 
frustrated with what they perceive as your lack of attention to detail.</p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>Perfectionism is self-abuse of the highest order.</ital>"<br>— Anne Wilson Schaef</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Irritability</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>Individuals who are high in Irritability may be more easily rattled 
by things, whether it be the shortcomings of others, one's environment, 
or the world in general. This might be due to a lower tolerance for 
frustration or a sensitivity to unpleasant stimuli. Individuals high in 
Irritability find themselves frequently bothered by things, often 
despite their efforts to feel otherwise. Although frequently feeling 
annoyed doesn't necessarily mean that a person will always show it 
outwardly or lose their temper, some individuals high in Irritability 
may be perceived as angrier than the average person. Conversely, an 
individual who scores low on Irritability may be fairly unperturbed by 
negative things, although this does not mean that they lack concern 
regarding what happens in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 40 on Irritability places you higher than 16% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

<div class="image-container">

<p></p>
<p>Your score on the Irritability scale indicates that you are less 
likely to experience frustration or anger in response to things. It may 
be that you are simply less fazed by the negative things that happen to 
you, or that you have cultivated your ability to be patient and less 
reactive to things. Whatever the underlying reason, you are likely to 
have a firm handle on your angry emotions and to be more moderate in 
your reactions to things than the average person.</p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>You don't have to attend every argument you're invited to.</ital>"<br></p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Order</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>Orderliness is generally valued as an aspect of personality because 
it is suggestive of tendencies towards organization, predictability, and
 cleanliness.  Like all traits however, it is not true that more orderly
 behavior is always better.  An excessive desire for order can lead to 
perfectionistic behaviors and unrealistic expectations.  In extreme 
cases, the inability to tolerate even small amounts of disorder may be 
associated with mental health issues.  Orderliness scores tend to be 
positively correlated with Industry and Perfectionism but are negatively
 correlated with Sensation-Seeking and Easy-Goingness.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 40 on Order places you higher than 16% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

<div class="image-container">

<p></p>
<p>Your score on the Order scale indicates that you are somewhat lower 
in orderliness.  While details may be important to you, you're willing 
to live with a fair bit of imperfection.  You may prefer order and 
regularity in your work and surroundings but it does not bother you to 
have things out of place.  You likely recognize that there are many 
aspects of life that simply cannot be controlled so there's no point in 
keeping things tidy all the time.</p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>If a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign?</ital>"<br>— Albert Einstein</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Emotional Stability</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>An Emotionally-Stable individual is not easily disturbed by daily 
hassles and recovers quickly when more substantial stressors inevitably 
occur.  Emotional stability is not necessarily synonymous with 
consistent positivity, but simply implies lower levels of reactivity.  
This trait is sometimes used to describe the opposite end of the trait 
of Neuroticism, though the latter tends to include a broader range of 
individual differences.  The key to Emotional Stability, as the name 
suggests, is the degree and speed with which moods shift.  Those who are
 high in stability are better able to endure stress without getting 
flustered.  Those who are low, by contrast, will experience more 
fluctuating moods as they go about their day.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 59 on Emotional Stability places you higher than 82% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

<div class="image-container">
<img src="report_full_html_files/59.png" width="600" height="294"><br></div>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:10px"><a href="#" onclick="window.open('normal.html', '', 'width=600,height=500');">click for more info about reading this image</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>Your score on the Emotional Stability scale indicates that you are 
somewhat high in stability.  You are probably less easily upset or 
emotionally reactive, and you may handle daily hassles better than most.
 Although you probably get agitated from time to time, you are more 
likely to deal effectively and coolly with frustrating or threatening 
situations. Due to your controlled reactions, at times others may find 
you cold or aloof.  Emotionally stable individuals tend to be more calm 
and free from persistent negative feelings. Freedom from negative 
feelings does not mean that these individuals experience more positive 
feelings than others, but they are less likely to experience frequent 
mood swings or be shook up by negative events. Some emotionally stable 
individuals may go so far as to seek out thrilling situations, such as 
scary movies and roller-coasters, because they perceive these situations
 to be less threatening than most people.</p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>When stability becomes a habit, maturity and clarity follow.</ital>"<br>— B.K.S. Iyengar</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Impulsivity</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>The trait of Impulsivity reflects the tendency to act on a whim, 
displaying behavior characterized by little or no forethought, 
reflection, or consideration of the consequences.  Attitudes about 
Impulsivity in popular culture are often varied and this leads to a stew
 of mixed messages.  While the prevailing sentiment in Western pop 
culture encourages spontaneity ("carpe diem!"), the consequences of rash
 behavior are often really unpleasant. More impulsive individuals are 
more likely to jump into things without consideration of the 
consequences and make decisions very quickly.  For some, this tendency 
is part of a broader worldview that life is better lived in the moment, 
through bold actions and no regrets.<br>In light of evidence that "gut" 
intuitions are often as good or better than strategic approaches to 
decision-making in situations with many uncontrollable factors, it can 
be hard to argue against the Impulsive approach to life.  But only to a 
point.  Less impulsive individuals tend to be more successful at tasks 
that require planning, preparation and persistence — and these tasks 
include many of those needed for a healthy and productive life.  Low 
impulsivity is also beneficial for social relationships, as it is 
associated with greater reliability, consistency, and consideration of 
the consequences of one's behavior on friends and family.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 57 on Impulsivity places you higher than 76% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

<div class="image-container">
<img src="report_full_html_files/57.png" width="600" height="294"><br></div>

<p></p>
<p>Your score on the Impulsivity scale indicates that you are a bit more
 impulsive than most.  While you probably know that certain situations 
require very deliberate decisions, it is likely that you also know when 
to let loose and not overthink things. Spur-of-the-moment choices have 
probably caused some behaviors that you later regretted, but that's the 
price to be paid when chasing after exciting life experiences. Others 
may admire your ability to balance fastidiousness with spontaneity.</p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.</ital>"<br>— Charles Bukowski</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Conservatism</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>The Conservatism factor brings together a number of attitudes which 
often, though not always, relate to each other. These include, perhaps 
most obviously, a tendency to support conservative politics and a strong
 nationalistic patriotism, but may also involve religiosity. Typically, 
individuals who score low in Conservatism tend to be less 
religious-minded and tend to vote for liberal political candidates. They
 may be less nationalistic than others. This dimension is also highly 
correlated with one's stance on related issues, such as the military, 
the role of government, the importance of national security, welfare, 
gun ownership, business, fiscal responsibility, and various values.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 43 on Conservatism places you higher than 24% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

<div class="image-container">

<p></p>
<p>Your score on the Conservatism scale indicates that you are somewhat 
lower in Conservatism. You may be more likely to support liberal 
candidates and less likely to be religious or nationalistic. Depending 
on your personal background and the country you live in, this may also 
mean that you lean towards supporting civil rights issues, place more 
faith in welfare programs, and are wary of traditional social roles and 
military expenditure, among other things. But as you don't lean too 
heavily in one political direction, it is possible that you are 
sometimes able to find more ideological common ground with 
conservatives.</p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>A liberal is a man

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Introspection</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>Introspection is a factor concerning one's tendency to turn thoughts 
inward and onto oneself, as well as one's efforts to grapple with 
understanding the world more deeply. Individuals high in Introspection 
may find themselves drifting off into spirals of thought as they 
consider things about life and try to understand their role within 
everything. They may be less content with existing explanations for 
different phenomena. Individuals low in Introspection may prefer to stay
 focused on what is in front of them and not to concern themselves over 
what is invisible or abstract. They may rely more on an intuitive 
understanding of the world and therefore feel less of a need to delve 
into things or to ruminate and reflect.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 44 on Introspection places you higher than 27% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p>Your score on the Introspection scale indicates that you are somewhat
 lower in Introspection. Most likely, you do not concern yourself too 
often with reflection and the pursuit of self-understanding, although 
you may have a moment here and there in which you contemplate your life.
 At the end of the day, you are likely focused on what you see as more 
productive modes of thought and action rather than rumination or 
daydreaming.</p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>I'm not used to introspection. I've never lingered on my feelings. The show must go on.</ital>"<br>— Brenda Lee</p>

<p></p>

<p>Well-Being is something that many people around the world covet and 
even see as life's ultimate goal — countless self-help materials have 
been developed with the intention of aiding people in this respect. 
Individuals who are high in Well-Being tend to feel good about 
themselves and their lives. They typically feel comfortable with who 
they are, and rarely experience feelings of worthlessness or 
hopelessness. This positive attitude towards oneself may confer a 
variety of benefits, including better relationships, better health, and 
less stress. Research shows that having perspective and gratitude can 
result in greater Well-Being. Those scoring low in Well-Being may have 
more difficulty enjoying what life has to offer.</p>

<p>Your score on the Well-Being scale indicates that you are somewhat

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Industry</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>Industry is characterized by the virtues of diligence and 
perseverance and industrious individuals tend to be hard-working, 
efficient, and reliable.  When given a task, they typically get to work 
right away and make a point of completing the task promptly and 
successfully.  Given their strong work ethic, industrious people tend to
 be pre-occupied, at times, with tasks that less-conscientious 
individuals do not value.  Less industrious individuals are not 
necessarily unproductive, but they do tend to be more laid back and more
 easily disinterested when the going gets tough.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 55 on Industry places you higher than 69% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

<p>Your score on the Industry scale indicates that you are fairly high 
in Industry.  You take pride in your work and you probably derive real 
pleasure from a job well done.  The risk, of course, is that you 
sometimes allow yourself to get caught up in your duties.  Over the long
 term, it is important to maintain a balance between the time you spend 
working and the time you spend taking care of yourself.</p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>I am a great believer in luck. The harder I work the more of it I seem to have.</ital>"<br>— Coleman Cox</p>

<p>The Conformity factor concerns an individual's self-perception of 
normalcy, as well as their desire to be seen as an ordinary or average 
person. The pressure to conform is strongly connected to group 
acceptance, and can emanate from many sources, including mainstream 
media, social institutions, families, and peers. In many cultures, being
 "normal" often means that one is more readily accepted and therefore 
likely able to access shared resources of both tangible and immaterial 
nature. An individual high in Conformity may feel these pressures more 
keenly and have more of a desire to feel and be seen as normal. They 
typically have less interest in sticking out or in flaunting their 
differences. They probably feel more comfortable finding common ground 
with others and identifying with the interests of others.  Conversely, 
an individual who is low in Conformity strives to be unique and would 
hate to be seen as ordinary or mainstream. They may pride themselves on 
thinking and acting outside the box.</p>

<p>Your score on the Conformity scale indicates that you are somewhat 
lower in Conformity. Most likely, you see yourself as a more unique 
individual. Others may perceive you as being a bit different, and this 
may not necessarily upset you. You may often bring originality and 
creativity of thought or expression to the table when others are stumped
 or stuck in a rut. You are probably not overly concerned with fitting 
in, or are at least willing to sacrifice some social commonality or 
agreement in the name of individuality and/or innovation.</p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>I think the reward for conformity is that everyone likes you except yourself.</ital>"<br>— Rita Mae Brown</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Art Appreciation</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>Art Appreciation involves an individual's interest in works of art 
and artistic activities. This includes one's attitudes towards poetry, 
the visual arts, performing arts, literature and more. A person high in 
Art Appreciation will seek exposure to these topics, though they may not
 be particularly artistic. Individuals low in Art Appreciation may not 
feel that art is particularly enticing or relevant to their lives, and 
likely concern themselves with work or hobbies of a different nature.</p>

<p>Your score on the Art Appreciation scale indicates that you are 
somewhat lower in Art Appreciation. Most likely, you do not concern 
yourself too often with artistic creation or consumption. It could be 
that you prefer certain types of art over others, or simply that you 
prefer activities unrelated to art altogether. Although you may be 
knowledgeable about aspects of the arts and literature, it is likely 
that art is not a very important part of your life.</p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.</ital>"<br>— Leonardo de Vinci</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Compassion</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>Individuals who are high in Compassion are likely to be perceived as 
warm and caring individuals who enable others to feel at ease in their 
presence. Although the draw to people high in Compassion is different 
from the draw to people who are charismatic or powerful, compassionate 
people are welcome friends who help those around them to feel cared for 
and understood.  Compassion is particularly important in the development
 and maintenance of positive social relationships and there is a growing
 body of evidence that these are crucial for well-being across the 
lifespan.  For this reason, Compassion is viewed by many as an important
 component of a happy life.</p>

<p>Your score on the Compassion scale indicates that you are a bit less 
focused on the feelings and needs of others. It may simply be that the 
conditions of your life require you to attend to your own needs first 
and foremost! It is likely that although you don't shut other people out
 entirely, you believe that most people are equipped to take care of 
themselves. People probably know not to badger you with personal or 
emotional requests. Even if you see a sad movie, you are less likely to 
empathize with the characters to the point of being moved to tears.</p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>Put on your own oxygen mask before helping others.</ital>"<br>— Randy Pausch, 'The Last Lecture'</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Attention-Seeking</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>Despite the connotations that are often associated with 
Attention-Seeking, it is not necessarily a narcissistic or negative 
trait. Rather, Attention-Seeking can be motivated by a variety of 
concerns, including a desire to please people by making them happy or 
entertained. Those who are more sociable, humorous and charismatic often
 take center stage at social gatherings, for example, so it should be no
 surprise that Attention-Seeking is most highly correlated with those 
traits. It is true of course that those high in Attention-Seeking 
sometimes put on a show to impress others and this behavior is sometimes
 perceived as self-serving.  Attention-seeking behavior is often quite 
effective and this means that individuals who are high in this trait are
 often perceived as being more popular and having more social 
connections. Individuals low in Attention-Seeking prefer to be on the 
sidelines and out of the spotlight. This sometimes allows them to be 
more observant of what is going on around them. Though they are less 
likely than those high in Attention-Seeking to be noticed or immediately
 admired, they are not necessarily misanthropic or without social 
skills. They may simply prefer social interactions in which all parties 
contribute on a roughly equal level.</p>

<p>Your score on the Attention-Seeking scale indicates that you are 
somewhat high in Attention-Seeking. Most likely, finding yourself at the
 center of others' attention doesn't upset you too much. At a social

Still, there are probably times when you would prefer to escape or avoid
 the spotlight in order to make time for quiet reflection and

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Charisma</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>The Charisma scale measures one's adeptness in a range of social 
situations. Charisma is often described as one of those unusual traits 
that are hard to define but easy to recognize in others.  It is broadly 
understood as one's skill in handling interpersonal relations and 
influencing others. It seems to involve a variety of factors including 
confidence, friendliness, expressive body language, warmth and 
sincerity. Individuals with unusually high Charisma are social 
butterflies who rarely seem flustered or disconcerted. They can often 
seem impressively uninhibited when approaching others or speaking 
publicly. Individuals low in Charisma often find it difficult to know 
what to say or do around other people and struggle to get others to see 
their way.  While Charisma often contributes to strong leadership 
potential, many successful leaders have been notoriously uncharismatic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 46 on Charisma places you higher than 34% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

sometimes find yourself at a loss for what to say or do around other 
people. Although you may have deep and enduring relationships with those
 close to you, you struggle a bit to find points of commonality with 
strangers or to engage in more shallow small-talk at networking events.

you out more than most.</p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>Charisma becomes the undoing of leaders.  It makes them inflexible, convinced of their own infallibility, unable to change.</ital>"<br>— Peter Drucker</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Emotional Expressiveness</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>The Emotional Expressiveness factor involves the degree to which an 
individual is comfortable sharing their feelings, perspectives, and 
experiences with others. Emotional expressiveness is related to emotion 
regulation, though the nature of this relationship can be complicated.  
Those who are emotionally expressive tend to be more aware of how 
they're feeling, and it is generally believed that higher levels of 
expression are helpful for emotion regulation.  It may also be the case 
however that excessive emotional expression (or emotional expression 
that is not well-received by others) can be counter-productive for 
emotion regulation.  Individuals who are high in Emotional 
Expressiveness are less inhibited about showing their emotions in front 
of others, and may be less concerned with how others perceive them. 
Individuals low in Emotional Expressiveness typically feel more pressure
 to keep up an appearance of emotional stability, and may be more 
guarded in showing their true feelings.</p>

<p>Your score on the Emotional Expressiveness scale indicates that you 
are somewhat low in Emotional Expressiveness. Most likely, you are a bit
 more guarded about sharing your feelings and revealing information 
about yourself. It may be that you are wary of burdening others with 
your negative feelings, or that you just don't feel comfortable talking 
about your emotions.  While you may be much more open with others after 
you get to know them a little, they will probably have to earn your 
trust before you're comfortable revealing your true self. </p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>The world is a tragedy to those who feel, but a comedy to those who think.</ital>"<br>— Horace Walpole</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Honesty</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>The Honesty dimension relates mainly to the behaviors of cheating or 
lying, but it also extends more generally to include one's willingness 
to take advantage of others for their own benefit.  Individuals who are 
less honest would be more likely, for example, to deceive others or cut 
corners when there are no perceived consequences (and maybe even when 
there are consequences).  Highly honest individuals, on the other hand, 
are more likely to uphold social norms about stealing, cheating, and 
acting in good faith in interpersonal relationships.  Of course, the 
social demands for honesty are quite high and, ironically, dishonest 
individuals may be relatively unlikely to respond openly to items about 
lying and cheating. The feedback provided here is based on the answers 
you gave, so the accuracy of your scores will reflect the degree to 
which you were honest with yourself!</p>

advantage of someone for your own ends.  You probably do your best to be
 fair and stick to your word.  You may be disappointed from time to time
 by others who fail to uphold the same standards but you also recognize 
that some people value honesty less than their own success in life.</p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>No legacy is so rich as honesty.</ital>"<br>— Shakespeare, 'All's Well That Ends Well'</p>

<p>The Sensation-Seeking factor involves one's desire to engage in more 
adventurous or risky activities. Sensation-Seeking can take a variety of
 forms; for instance, some individuals who score highly may love scaling
 mountains but eschew recreational drug use, while others feel the 
opposite. Individuals high in Sensation-Seeking may feel bored when idle
 or if they go long stretches with nothing exciting or thrilling to do. 
Individuals low in Sensation-Seeking derive less pleasure from thrilling
 activities, often because they find higher levels of arousal 
unpleasant.</p>

individuals who score highly in the Easy-Goingness trait are content to 
let life proceed at its own pace, those who score low tend to prefer to 
grab life by the horns. Whereas in some cultures someone who is high in 
Easy-Goingness may be criticized as lazy or lay-about, in others such an
 individual is perceived as being content with the way they live their 
lives. Similarly, someone low in Easy-Goingness could be described as 
either a go-getter or as overly high-strung.</p>

easy, and feel less of a need to force things to run more efficiently.

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Self Control</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>Self-Control is a measure of a person's ability to control their 
short-term desires, often for the sake of long-term benefit. This can 
involve an individual's adeptness at controlling cravings, or by the 
same token the frequency with which an individual finds themselves 
succumbing to temptation. Individuals high in Self-Control have an 
easier time holding themselves back from something that might cause them
 trouble in the long run. Individuals who score lower will often find 
themselves splurging, and may adopt a policy of "act now, figure it out 
later" when faced with something enticing. Ultimately, they ascribe to a
 more hedonistic lifestyle, and may see less point in delaying pleasure.
  Many people wonder how Self-Control and Impulsivity are related.  They
 tend to have a moderate negative correlation (about -0.4).  
Self-Control relates more to the resistance of urges, temptations and 
cravings whereas Impulsivity more generally reflects acting before 
thinking.</p>

 less difficulty saying no. Your self-discipline and forward thinking 
may mean that you miss out on more fun in the shorter-term, but that

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Sociability</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>Sociability relates to behaviors that are predictable given the name 
of the trait — individuals who are highly sociable prefer to be around 
other people much more than being alone.  Of course, humans are social 
animals so most individuals do not like to go long periods of time 
without social contact of one form or another.  Individuals differ 
however in terms of the extent to which they can handle large crowds or 
nearly constant socialization.  Individuals who are low on Sociability 
prefer small groups and may even prefer to be alone most of the time.  
Those who are high on Sociability think of themselves as alone when 
working in a loud coffeeshop and prefer to be surrounded by large groups
 of friends.  Sociability is a hallmark of Extraversion so it is no 
surprise that it is moderately-to-strongly correlated with the traits of
 Sensation-Seeking (.4), Attention-Seeking (.5), and Charisma (.5).  But
 it is also positively correlated with a sense of well-being, likely due
 to humans' strong need for social support and friendship.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Creativity scale measures one's tendency to come up with new and 
different ideas, as well as one's interest in breaking from the mold and
 following less trodden paths, whether through work or hobbies. 
Creativity is not the same thing as intelligence, but rather a 
particular mode of thinking and expression. Individuals high in 
Creativity may be better at more creative jobs that allow room for 
creative expression than those which are heavily structured. They may 
also be better at divergent thinking, which entails coming up with 
multiple solutions to a single problem.  This is distinguished from 
convergent thinking, which involves finding the single correct answer to
 a problem. Individual's lower in Creativity are by no means necessarily
 less smart, but may simply have more respect for previously established
 modes of thinking and an appreciation for simplicity and tradition.</p>

<p>The Intellect scale measures how quickly an individual grasps new 
concepts, and how much information they can mentally handle at once. A 
person's Intellect score is not necessarily a complete indicator of how 
"smart" they are, let alone how much they know, but rather a more 
specific measure of the speed with which they learn new things. Of 
course, intelligence, which is a broader concept unique from one's 
Intellect, can also involve one's ability to recall and utilize what one
 has learned, to think deeply and critically, and even to stick to the 
task of learning. While an individual with a higher Intellect score 
might process a lot of new material quickly, someone with a lower 
Intellect score might adopt a more methodical or pragmatic approach.</p>

<p>An adaptable individual is someone who can more readily adjust to

Adaptability also relates to one's ability to perform on the fly, or 
conversely to one's preference for comprehensive planning. Individuals 
low in Adaptability may find themselves more flustered by change, as 
they prefer plans and the stability of repetition. Not knowing what will

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Authoritarianism</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>The Authoritarianism dimension relates to an individual's attitudes 
about rules and laws. Those high in Authoritarianism typically believe 
that laws exist for good reason (to keep those who would otherwise 
transgress in line) and thus should be unequivocally obeyed. To such an 
individual, authority is crucial to maintaining social order, and 
rebellious behavior should be nipped in the bud. This belief may be 
rooted in a more negative view of humanity as naturally unruly and 
therefore requiring authority to be properly whipped into shape.  Those 
who are low in Authoritarianism believe that strict laws and punishments
 are not always necessary or useful for reducing crime and improving 
society.  This view is often borne out of concerns that many rules and 
laws are biased or are not equally enforced among all individuals.  
While these issues are better suited for political and philosophical 
forums, the reality is that perspectives on these issues underlie 
differences in the trait of Authoritarianism.  Authoritarianism tends to
 be moderately positively correlated (0.4) with Conservatism.</p>

probably try to follow the rules and believe that even if laws aren't 
always perfect, they play an important part in reducing crime and 
ensuring safety for the greatest number of people.</p><p style="text-align:center">"<ital>We do disagreeable things so that ordinary people here and elsewhere can sleep safely in their beds at night.</ital>"<br>— John Le Carre, 'The Spy Who Came in From the Cold'</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Agreeableness</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>Features of Agreeableness include compassion, trust, honesty, and 
politeness but the defining characteristic may well be empathy. It seems
 that the ability to recognize others' emotions contributes to all of 
these underlying traits as well as many other nuances of personality 
that are often associated with agreeable people. Agreeableness also 
reflects individual differences in cooperation and social harmony.  
While agreeable people are typically more popular than those low on 
Agreeableness, it is not popularity that motivates them so much as the 
desire to avoid (or reduce) conflict in their immediate environment.  
While this quality has several obvious benefits, Agreeableness is not 
necessarily useful in situations that are highly stressful or that 
frequently involve tough decisions.  As a result, people who feel less 
need to be agreeable often make excellent scientists, critics, or 
soldiers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 52 on Agreeableness places you higher than 58% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p>Your score on the Agreeableness scale indicates that you are 
relatively agreeable. You probably have an interest in others' needs and
 well-being, and you share in both their joys and their challenges. It 
may be that your compassion is limited to some individuals (perhaps 
friends and family) without extending to acquaintances or strangers. You
 are most likely pleasant, sympathetic, and cooperative. You may like 
doing things for others, especially when they are in need, sometimes 
even if this puts their needs ahead of your own. It's also likely you 
are less easily annoyed by others. You may sometimes lose your temper or
 make insulting judgments about the people with whom you interact, but 
for the most part you probably avoid judging or criticizing those around
 you. You can probably receive criticism without holding a grudge.  
Highly agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are 
therefore considerate, friendly, generous, helpful, and willing to 
compromise their interests for the sake of others. Agreeable people also
 tend to have an optimistic view of human nature. They believe people 
are basically honest, decent, and trustworthy.</p>

<p></p>
<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Conscientiousness</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>By definition, a conscientious individual is guided by an inner sense
 of what is "right" (this inner sense being known as one's 
"conscience"). While they may hold dramatically different opinions about
 the nature of socially acceptable behavior, conscientious individuals 
typically have reputations for being meticulous, thorough, and 
deliberate. Extreme conscientiousness can lead to unrealistic 
expectations and perfectionistic behaviors that are ultimately 
unproductive.  Conscientiousness is most highly associated with Industry
 and Order, though it is also positively correlated with low 
impulsivity, authoritarian views, honest behavior and strong 
self-control.  Most of these traits relate to self-discipline in one way
 or another, a feature which likely contributes to the similarity 
between Conscientiousness and traditional conceptions of "character."  
While some of the traits within Conscientiousness seem similar enough to
 be redundant, they generally have unique relationships with other 
aspects of behavior.  For example, Impulsivity relates to the general 
tendency to act without thinking while Self-Control is the ability to 
resist temptations and cravings.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 48 on Conscientiousness places you higher than 42% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

<div class="image-container">

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:10px"><a href="#" onclick="window.open('normal.html', '', 'width=600,height=500');">click for more info about reading this image</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>Your score on the Conscientiousness scale indicates that you are 
somewhat laid back; details, order, ambition, and goals are probably not
 the highest priorities for you. Although you may prefer regularity or 
work hard at times, it is likely you are not insistent on perfection. 
You may sometimes prefer to live for the moment and do what feels good 
now, instead of delaying gratification for the sake of longer-term 
objectives. Your work may also tend to be a little more careless or 
disorganized. On the other hand, you are less likely to be a workaholic,
 and others may see you as easy-going and fun-to-be-with.  Individuals 
who are more laid back than you can have trouble detecting mistakes or 
inconsistencies. However, they rarely have unrealistic expectations and 
they are less pre-occupied with tasks.</p>
<hr>
<!-- Number 3 of 5 -->

<p></p>
<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Extraversion</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>Extraversion is perhaps the most widely recognized feature of human 
personality. The popularized notion of Extraversion is mainly limited to
 the idea that extraverts seek out social interaction while introverts 
spend more time alone. Personality theorists suggest that the 
extraversion/introversion dimension is more accurately framed as a 
function of stimulation. Individuals who are more sensitive to outside 
stimuli (introverts) tend to prefer interacting in small groups. They 
also engage more often in independent, analytical, and 
cognitively-demanding activities. Extraverts are less sensitive to 
external stimuli and, as a result, seek more of it. They tend to enjoy 
large gatherings, act more gregariously, and are quick to assert 
themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 50 on Extraversion places you higher than 50% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

<div class="image-container">

<p></p>
<p>Your score on the Extraversion scale indicates that you are somewhat 
extraverted. You probably prefer to be around people a lot of the time 
and are sociable, outgoing, energetic, and lively. Most likely, you do 
not often keep others at a distance and you probably spend a good amount
 of time chatting, even with people you've never met. You probably enjoy
 large parties and meeting new people, but it may depend on the 
circumstances and your energy level. It may also seem that you have more
 energy than most others. You probably like to take charge more than the
 average person, and are more willing than most to make speeches or 
toasts in front of a large crowd (though you don't necessarily enjoy 
it).</p>
<hr>
<!-- Number 4 of 5 -->

<p></p>
<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Neuroticism</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>The trait of Neuroticism is marked by elevated reactivity to stress 
and the more frequent experience of emotions that most people view as 
negative or unpleasant — anxiety, sadness, frustration, fear, and anger.
  Neurotic individuals view the world as relatively more threatening and
 dangerous.  Historically, use of the label neuroticism (or neurotic, as
 an adjective) stemmed from the idea that individuals behave in ways 
that are more or less affected by neuroses — nervous disorders.  While 
the term neurosis is now rarely used by health professionals, the term 
Neuroticism is still used for the personality trait relating to the 
persistent tendency to be in a negative mood state.  Some people feel 
that this label is unnecessarily negative, though the truth is that 
nearly everyone behaves neurotically from time to time and most neurotic
 behaviors are within socially acceptable limits.  Individuals with low 
levels of neuroticism are less likely to become upset by stress and 
spend relatively less time feeling worried, scared, and angry — but just
 about everyone experiences these emotions sometimes.  It's no surprise 
that highly neurotic individuals are at risk for a range of mental 
health concerns, but more recent research suggests that these risks also
 extend to several physical health concerns.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 37 on Neuroticism places you higher than 10% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

<div class="image-container">
<img src="report_full_html_files/37.png" width="600" height="294"><br></div>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:10px"><a href="#" onclick="window.open('normal.html', '', 'width=600,height=500');">click for more info about reading this image</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>Your score on the Neuroticism scale indicates that you are very even 
tempered. Compared to most people, you probably experience fewer 
emotional swings throughout the day and you react less strongly to 
stressful events.  While you do feel negative emotions (fear/worry, 
sadness, irritability, anger) on occasion, you likely feel this less 
often and less intensely than most people.  It is likely that others 
this in you (perhaps with some envy), and they appreciate your typically
 calm demeanor.</p>
<hr>
<!-- Number 5 of 5 -->

<p></p>
<h3 style="text-align:center"><strong>Openness</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>Openness is probably the most broadly encompassing factor of 
personality.  In fact, many people are surprised to learn that the two 
most widely studied aspects (Intellect and Openness to New Experiences) 
are highly positively correlated.  This positive association can be 
explained by the fact that both aspects share the common trait of being 
willing to engage with new ideas.  Openness is also associated with 
traits such as Creativity, Art Appreciation, Introspection, (low) 
Conformity, and Adaptability.  Openness is often presented as healthier 
or more mature by psychologists, who are often themselves very open. 
However, open and conventional styles of thinking are useful in 
different environments. For example, the intellectual style of an open 
person may be useful for endeavors that reward novelty, but the more 
conventional approach of an individual who is low on openness often 
leads to superior job performance in occupations that emphasize 
procedure and compliance.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Your score of 47 on Openness places you higher than 38% of previous participants in this survey.</strong></p>

<div class="image-container">
<img src="report_full_html_files/47_002.png" width="600" height="294"><br></div>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:10px"><a href="#" onclick="window.open('normal.html', '', 'width=600,height=500');">click for more info about reading this image</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>Your score on the Openness scale indicates that you are somewhat 
conventional. You probably prefer to think and act in straight-forward, 
traditional ways. While you may enjoy working on complex problems at 
times, you probably don't seek them out very often. Others might 
describe you as down-to-earth and practical. You may be less comfortable
 handling lots of information, or you may find many intellectual 
activities a bit boring or unpleasant.  While you might enjoy certain 
aspects of the arts and sciences, the most highly conventional 
individuals often view these domains with skepticism or of little 
practical use.  Conventional people tend to prefer familiarity over 
novelty, and this preference often underlies conservative beliefs and a 
resistance to change.  Very conventional individuals sometimes hold 
fundamentalist or dogmatic beliefs.</p>

<p>While there are several competing theories in cognitive ability 
research, there is also growing consensus that abilities are best 
organized hierarchically. In other words, each of the many different 
components of cognitive ability involve different sets of skills and 
these components are typically organized according to similarities among
 the tasks/skills involved.  On the most narrow level, it is often 
difficult to distinguish between the skills used to accomplish a given 
task, but on the broadest level (at the top of the hierarchy), general 
skill sets are more plainly evident.  For example, the skills required 
for different types of verbal tasks are more similar than those required
 for verbal and spatial tasks.</p><p>The items given here include 
several different types and we are actively working to develop more.  In
 order to keep the test short, each participant is only administered a 
subset of the question types.  Current question types include Letter and
 Number Series, Matrix Reasoning, Three-Dimensional Rotations, Verbal 
Reasoning (which includes general knowledge, logic and arithmetic 
questions), Figural Analogies, Two-Dimensional Rotations, Compound 
Remote Associates, Additions and Subtractions, Propositional Reasoning, 
and Emotion Recognition.</p><p>At this time, we are only giving feedback
 based on your responses to the Letter and Number Series items, the 
Three-Dimensional Rotation items, the Matrix Reasoning items, and the 
Verbal Reasoning items.  This is because we don't yet have a big enough 
sample to generate representative norms for the other item types.  Your 
responses have contributed to the development of these norms for future 
test-takers.</p>

<p><strong>Based on the 8 responses you gave for the item types with 
norms (see above), your Cognition score was 67.  This means that your 
score was higher than 96% of previous participants in this survey.</strong>
  The average score for Cognition is 50.   While scores on these items 
are positively correlated with commercial IQ measures, we discourage 
participants from considering their score to be a proxy for such 
measures.  This "test" differs from most commercial tests in terms of 
brevity and the fact that it is administered online without a time limit
 in an un-proctored setting.  It is important to take these factors into
 account when comparing your performance against the average.  We 
recognize that many participants would like to know the correct 
responses for these cognitive ability items, but we do not currently 
make this information available in order to maintain the validity of the
 questions. </p>
